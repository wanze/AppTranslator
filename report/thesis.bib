		 machine translation whose novel contributions are (a)
		 support for linguistically motivated factors, (b)
		 confusion network decoding, and (c) efficient data
		 formats for translation models and language models. In
		 addition to the SMT decoder, the toolkit also includes
		 a wide variety of tools for training, tuning and
		 applying the system to many translation tasks.",
