\noindent 
Every day, hundreds of mobile applications are added to stores such as Google Play or AppStore. Many of them are intended to be used internationally, and thus require translation of the interface. At the same time, many more mobile apps already available for download in these stores. Leveraging the translation bases of existing applications, we could immediately provide high-quality translations for new apps without need to go though a human-translation process. 

This project aims to extract and parse translations of existing applications to see if they can be used to translate new ones. A prototype application allows to translate existing apps from a given source to a target language. Translations are generated with different algorithms in statistical machine translation.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}

Android, iPhone and Windows smart phones are available in countries all over the world. If an app is intended to be used internationally, translating it into multiple languages can be important to attract users. Users may only use the app if its text is available in their native language. Offering multiple languages is therefore crucial for paid apps to increase sales. However, translating an app requires additional effort. From a developers perspective, all strings must be isolated in order to replace them with different values for each supported language. Furthermore, translating text itself is a difficult task which usually requires the work of a professional translator.

The main idea of this thesis is to collect a lot of existing apps and extract their translations. Are we able to provide high quality translations with the help of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)? To reduce the scope of different mobile operating systems and languages, we focus on automatic translations of Android apps from English to French and German. From now on, the term \emph{app} in this thesis refers to a Android application. We have chosen French and German as target languages for the translations because they are natively spoken in Switzerland, which makes understanding the produced results easier. %Also our data analysis showed that these two languages are very popular.% 
SMT is the dominant approach in automating translations and used by services like \emph{Google Translate}\footnote{\url{https://translate.google.com}} and \emph{Bing Translator}\footnote{\url{https://www.bing.com/translator}} (Microsoft). In this thesis, we use different SMT algorithms to produce translations and compare their results, both manually and automatically. A prototype web application is built which serves as a playground to translate strings and apps.

\chapter{Problem Analysis}
\label{cha:problem_analysis}

This chapter answers the question why it is important to offer multiple languages for apps.  

%Furthermore we take a look at existing translation services and briefly introduce how the service developed with this thesis is going to work. %

Google encourages developers to localize their apps on their localization checklist. \footnote{Android localization checklist: \url{http://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/localization-checklist.html}}

\begin{quote}
Android and Google Play offer you a worldwide audience for your apps, with an addressable user base that's growing very rapidly in countries such as Japan, Korea, India, Brazil, and Russia. We strongly encourage you to localize as it can maximize your apps’ distribution potential resulting in ratings from users around the world.
\end{quote}

The developer should first identify the countries where the app will be distributed based on the overall market size and opportunity, app category, local pricing etc. According to the identified countries, the supported languages are determined. Ideally an app supports multiple languages already before the first version is available in the app store. Users may install the app only once and forget about it, if they are not able to understand it.

Since 2013, Google offers an (human-based) app translation service to developers.\footnote{Android Developers Blog post about Googles translation service: \url{http://android-developers.blogspot.ch/2013/11/app-translation-service-now-available.html}} Several developers who participated at the pilot program shared their results after translating their apps:

\begin{quote}
The developers of Zombie Ragdoll\footnote{Game Zombie Ragdoll in the Google Playstore: \url{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rvappstudios.zombieragdoll}} used this tool to launch their new game simultaneously in 20 languages in August 2013. When they combined app translation with local marketing campaigns, they found that 80\% of their installs came from non-English-language users. Dating app SayHi\footnote{Dating app SayHi! in the Google Playstore: \url{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unearby.sayhi}} Chat expanded into 13 additional languages using the App Translation Service. They saw 120\% install growth in localized markets and improved user reviews of the professionally translated UI. The developer of card game G4A Indian Rummy\footnote{Card game Indian Rummy \url{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.games4all.android.games.indianrummy.prod}} found that the App Translation Service was easier to use than their previous translation methods, and saw a 300\% increase with user engagement in localized apps.
\end{quote}


In 2012, \emph{App Annie} (former called \emph{Distimo})\footnote{\url{https://www.appannie.com}}, published a study\footnote{App Annie's study The impact of app translations: \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20150327084808/http://www.distimo.com/publications}} where they analysed the impact of translations to iPhone apps\footnote{\url{https://gigaom.com/2012/10/01/distimo-app-translation-can-pay-off-especially-in-asia/}}. They found out that the use of native language is still limited in several countries, for example Italy, Russia or Brazil. Native-only apps are mostly used in Asian countries (see Figure \ref{fig:problem_analysis_impact_languages}).
The study followed 200 iPhone apps that introduced native language support in a market and observed their growth. Only one week after the local language support was introduced with an app update, downloading increased by 128\% and revenue by 26\%.

%Another case-study by David Janner from make app magazine\footnote{\url{http://makeappmag.com/iphone-app-localization-keywords}} observed the impact of translating one single app.

How 

\section{Statistical Machine Translation}

Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is based on a large corpus of bilingual data. A translation model is trained to output the best possible translation according to some probabilistic function. Therefore we need to get a sufficient amount of sentences from Android apps in order to train these models.

% Android apps can be installed on a mobile device by downloading a .apk file from the Google Playstore. Some reverse engineering is necessary to extract the translations from the binary file. Unfortunately, multilingual apps are not marked as such in the Google PlayStore. This means that we don't know if a app provides any translations prior to downloading and extracting it.
%


\section{Challenges}

Challenges:


\begin{itemize}
\item Quality of existing translations
\item Where and how to obtain large amount of apps
\item Hardware to train the translation models
\item How many data is needed to produce good results?
\item How can we measure good translations?
\end{itemize}



%\section{Android apps and internationalization}

%Android uses a key-value based approach to store translations and other resources in XML files\footnote{\url{http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization.html}}. For each supported language, one XML file exists, containing the translated values to given keys. In the source code, a string is no longer hardcoded but referenced by a translation key.%

\chapter{Related Work}
%In which we learn what have other done to address similar problems. For example, the work of Star \cite{Star89}

%Overview of SMT
%Has been done but not specific domain of short sentences mobile

This chapter provides an overview of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). We consider two different models. The first one is called \textbf{Statistical Phrase-Based Translation} and was introduced in 2003 by Philipp Koehn et al. \cite{smt_phrase_based} The second, more recent model, uses \textbf{Deep Learning Neural Networks} to perform translations. \cite{smt_deep_learning} SMT translation models are usually trained on a large parallel corpus which is freely available on the web \footnote{\url{http://www.statmt.org/europarl/}}. The BLEU metric is then used to measure the quality of the produced translations.
There exists a recurring translation task of the ``Workshop on statistical machine translation'', which focuses on translating european language pairs by improving existing systems\footnote{\url{http://www.statmt.org/wmt15/translation-task.html}}.

This thesis compares how both approaches perform in the context of translating short sentences of mobile apps. The models are therefore applied on a much smaller data set than usual.

\section{Phrase-Based Machine Translation}

\subsection{Model}

Given the task to translate a sentence from a foreign language \(f = f_1, f_2, f_3..., f_m\) into an english sentence \(e = e_1, e_2, e_3 ..., e_n\), the translation model is based on the following probabilistic equation:

\[P(e|f)\]

To find the best english translation, the following equation is used (Bayes rule).

\[e_{best} = argmax_eP(e|f)\]
\[= argmax_e\frac{P(f|e)P(e)}{P(f)}\]
\[= argmax_e P(e|f)P(e)\]

where \(P(e)\) is called the \textbf{language model} and \(P(f|e)\) is the \textbf{translation model}.

The translation model is further decomposed:

\[p(\bar{f}_1^I|\bar{e}_1^I) = \prod_{i=1}^I \phi(\bar{f}_i^I|\bar{e}_i^I) d(start_i - end_{i-1} -1)\]

where \(\phi\) is called the \textbf{phrase translation probability} and \(d\) is the \textbf{reordering probability}.

\chapter{Data Analysis}

\section{Apps}

A total of 698 free Android apps were collected from various categories\footnote{Click on Categories to see a list of available categories at:  \url{https://play.google.com/store/apps?hl=en}}, ensuring a good mix of different translations. Most of them were chosen randomly beside the top apps, mostly from Google, that ensure good translation quality of different languages. Figure \ref{fig:data_analysis_top_apps_en} shows the top ten apps according to the number of available english translations. Note that the counts indicate the number of effective translations after eliminating uninteresting data during pre-processing the corpus (see. chapter XY). Most of the apps have similar counts for all the three languages. Surprisingly, some apps provide more translations for german and french than english. Different counts can happen because of:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Not all strings were translated to all languages. Some english words don't need to be translated, e.g. E-Mail.
\item Some translations were abandoned during pre-processing.
\item The XML files containing the translations are out of sync.
\end{enumerate}

34 apps did not isolate their strings in XML files (we assume that they are hardcoded in the programming code). This leaves a effective number of 664 apps where we could extract translations. However, 241 apps were not multilingual and therefore not useful for building translation systems. Unfortunately, apps are not marked as multi-language in the app store, so we only know if there are translations available after downloading and extracting the data.

\end{figure}


\section{Languages}

We collected a total of 423 multilingual apps, offering its content at least for two languages. Figure \ref{fig:data_analysis_n_langs} shows the number of apps for the ten most used languages. French and German, where we focus on this thesis, are both in the top 4. The top apps are translated in many languages. In total, 117 different languages were available.

\chapter{Data Extraction, Preparation and Storage}


\section{Extract Translations}

An android app has the form of a single binary file (suffix .apk). The XML files containing the translations are packed inside the .apk file. We used a software called ``Apktool''\footnote{\url{http://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/}} to reverse engineer existing apps and extract the needed XML files.

\section{Preprocess Translations}

This task involves two parts. First of all, the translations are sanitized from unwanted information such as HTML tags. Some strings are omitted at this stage because they do not provide any meaningful value to the translation process, for example URLs or string placeholders. Secondly, the sanitized strings are prepared to be read by an SMT system.

\subsection{Sanitizing}

The following rules are used to get rid of unwanted translations or parts of it:

\begin{itemize}
\item Trim the string from newlines (\texttt{\textbackslash n}), tabs (\textbackslash t) or carriage return (\textbackslash r)
\item Strip any HTML tags
\item Omit strings that are URLs (starting with http or www)
\item Remove strings placeholders like \texttt{\%s} or \texttt{\%1\$s}
\item Ignore words with less than 3 characters
\item Finally, the resulting string is trimmed again from spaces and must contain at least one alphanumerical character
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Tokenization and Truecasing}

Tokenization is required to separate words from punctuation. Each token is separated by a space character: ``\texttt{Hi, my name is John.}'' becomes ``\texttt{Hi , my name is John .}''

After tokenizsation, truecasing was applied to our text corpus.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truecasing}} In contrast to lowercasing, truecasing determines the proper capitalization of words. This is done by first analyzing all data and then apply the most likely capitalization. It is especially useful for words starting a sentence, that are written uppercase in many languages. For example the word ``\texttt{This}'' starting a sentence will become ``\texttt{this}'', because it is usually written lowercase.


\section{Data storage}


\subsection{Parallel and Monolingual Corpus}

After pre-processing the translations, they are written to text files, one sentence per line. The corpus is split into parallel and monolingual data. A parallel corpus (often also called bitext) describes sentence aligned text-files of one language pair. All sentences must be aligned so that line x of the translation source language corresponds to line x of the target language. The sentences are shuffled before writing to get a random mix of translations of different apps. Most SMT system use this parallel data to train their translation model, so the parallel corpus can be reused multiple times.

In addition, data of any language is also stored monolingual. All sentences of one language are written into a single text file. This is for example used to build language models, which are an important part of a phrase-based translation model (see chapter xy).

\subsection{Apache Solr}

We needed a simple way to store all translations, preferably with additional meta data, to perform data analysis and calculate statistics.
Apache Solr\footnote{\url{http://lucene.apache.org/solr/}} is used for this purpose. Solr is an open source text search platform built on top of Apache Lucene\footnote{\url{https://lucene.apache.org/core/}}. It allows to store the translations with additional meta data, such as the translation key and a unique app ID. Due to its way of indexing text data, Solr is very fast when querying for translation strings. Furthermore, built in tools allow to get nice statistics, for example the top terms grouped by language.

Solr is also used as Baseline translation system (see chapter xy).

\subsubsection{Setup and Schema}

Solr offers so called \emph{cores} where each core manages a separate index, schema and configuration\footnote{\url{https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Solr+Cores+and+solr.xml}}. In our setup we created one core per language and one document per translation string. The schema is identical for each core (language) and consist of the following fields:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{id} Unique ID used by Solr to identify a document.
\item \textbf{app\_id} Each app must have a unique app-ID.
\item \textbf{key} The translation key from the XML file.
\item \textbf{value} The translation value corresponding to the above key.
\item \textbf{value\_lc} Again the translation value, additionally indexed with a special start- and ending delimiter. This allows to search for exact values.
\end{itemize}
